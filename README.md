Giiker Super Slide is an interactive sliding puzzle game where players shift blocks to create a path for the target block to reach the exit. This web implementation faithfully recreates the physical Giiker Super Slide puzzle game experience with a modern digital interface.

## How To Play

The goal is simple but challenging:

- Move the big red square (target block) to the exit zone
- Blocks can only slide horizontally or vertically
- Blocks cannot be lifted or overlap with each other
- Complete each puzzle in the minimum number of moves for the best score
